Updates for v0.21:
	-Fixed bug causing infinite loop if character was entered in
	 during gameplay instead of an integer.
	-Fixed bug that gives Cat's Game result no matter what the 
	 result if the board is filled at the end of the game.

Updates for v0.2:
	-Cleaned up code and fixed header file so that each function
	 function gets it's own file and is easily accessible.
	-All other functionality is the same as v0.1.

This is still a super beta version of my command line Tic Tac Toe Game.

At the moment, all that can be done is play a 2 player game.

To install, simply untar and type 'make'

Then type ./TicTacToe

The game starts with X

to play, simply use the number pad to type which slot you want to play.
