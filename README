Update for v0.52
        -Set up a random int to generate whether X or O starts.
        -If a profile has been loaded, the SelectPlay function
         imports the player name and uses that in place of 'X.'

Update for v0.51
	-Silly blatant bug fix I can't even believe I missed...

Updates for v0.50
	-Implemented Profiles class.
	-Player can now crate a profile under their name and 
	 their wins, losses, and ties are now saved.
	-Makefile now checks to see if 'sav/' directory 
	 exists and creates it if necessary.
	-Profile save data is stored in 'sav/' directory.

Updates for v0.41
	-Bug fixes in random number seeding.

Updates for v0.4
	-Wrote a one player version with a difficulty level of
	 playing someone who has absolutely no idea about 
	 basic TicTacToe strategy.

Updates for v0.31
	-Cleaned up some of the code by removing commented lines 
	 that are no longer needed. Removed some unnecessary 
	 variables that were no longer used. Added consts to 
	 variables which do not change.
                
Updates for v0.3:
	-Added a main menu. This is now the main interface for the 
	 program to function.
	-Added Dutch language support. If you speak/read Dutch, you
	 can play Boter-kass-en-eiren.
	-Reorganized the file format so all the source and header files
	 are now placed in the src driectory.
	-Rewrote Makefile for better organization and functionality. 
	 The make file now creates a directory, obj, and places all 
	 the object files in this directory.

Updates for v0.21:
	-Fixed bug causing infinite loop if character was entered in
	 during gameplay instead of an integer.
	-Fixed bug that gives Cat's Game result no matter what the 
	 result if the board is filled at the end of the game.

Updates for v0.2:
	-Cleaned up code and fixed header file so that each function
	 function gets it's own file and is easily accessible.
	-All other functionality is the same as v0.1.

This is still a super beta version of my command line Tic Tac Toe Game.

At the moment, all that can be done is play a 2 player game.

To install, simply untar and type 'make'

Then type ./TicTacToe

The game starts with X

to play, simply use the number pad to type which slot you want to play.
